# CO2une

## Initial situation

In a business context, key economic figures will continue to dominate the decision-making basis in logistics in 2024. When it comes to choosing the mode of transportation, time and price are the main considerations. Air freight is often used instead of sea freight. Closed ports in Asia during the coronavirus pandemic and a blocked Suez Canal have not exactly contributed positively to this. At the same time, the CO² emissions per tonne-kilometer are much lower for shipping than for air freight. There is therefore a need on the market for a calculator that provides both economic and, above all, ecological data for logistics companies to help them decide on the most suitable means of transportation.

## Description

The initial plan is to program a landing page using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, which provides information about the application and is used to process payments. Furthermore, a demo can be booked and an email newsletter with news from the industry can be created. An account can also be created with CO2une.

The design of the actual application is planned for the future. The front end will be programmed with JavaScript. The backend programming is still open, as the developer must first acquire the ability.

## Goals

In the end, an application is to be offered to potential customers that provides a decision-making aid for transportation that takes CO² emissions into account and focuses on them.

## Process and steps

see Task-Management

## Description

1. input fields with starting point, via and destination
2. inclusion of possible means of transportation
3. calculation of the respective routes using the Google Maps API
4. calculation of the respective CO² emissions by conversion key (distance \* conversion factor)
5. output of the data (CO² emissions, duration, costs, recommended transportation, conversion of the CO² saved)

## Risks, opportunities and measures

### Risks

- Financial risk, through hosting the website and purchasing the Google Maps API

### Opportunities

- Acquisition of real customers
- Project for the personal portfolio
- Learning frontend and backend programming

### Measures

- Crowd funding
- Subsidizing
- private capital
